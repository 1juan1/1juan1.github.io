     <div class="column"><p>On some of my freetime I tutor young children from grades 1-3. I help them with all school subjects in both English and Spanish. I was tutored in the same program when I was in elementary school. That is why I decided to volunteer here. I could say this program has helped me develop better in school. On one of the first days I began tutoring I taught one of my students how to begin reading in english.</p></div>
