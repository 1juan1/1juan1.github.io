    <p>This is a complete research project that I did on the topic of why recreational marijuana shouldn't have been legalized. It is not the topic that makes this interesting but the fact that I did a research project. This project was done over a significant amount of time. I made this project in my sophomore honors english class. When I was doing this paper I thought it was a bad idea to legalize marijuana but my viewpoint has changed.</p>
