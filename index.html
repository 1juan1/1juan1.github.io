   <p>My name is Juan Yepez, I attended Pasadena High School and I'm part of the App Academy pathway. I am currently involved in the Spanish club. This club is devoted to celebrating the hispanic culture. I am also taking various AP courses. While taking these courses I've learned more into depth of Biology, European and U.S History and English Language. My favorite class is math. It is my favorite class because I enjoy problem solving. I also like biology, because it is very interesting to learn about living things and how they work.</p>
